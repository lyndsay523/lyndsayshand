I am an R&D statistician in the [statistical sciences department](https://www.sandia.gov/statistics/) at Sandia National Laboratories where I develop novel statistical approaches to national security problems. My research interests include spatial and spatio-temporal statistics, point process models, Bayesian hierarchical models, and Statistical methods for remotely-sensed data, atmospheric and climate applications.

I received my B.S. in Mathematics and Spanish at Bucknell University in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania after growing up skiing and swimming in Park City, Utah. Afterwards, I earned my Ph.D. in Statistics from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign where research focus was in spatial-temporal statistics. I developed prediction models for the spatial spread of diseases such as West Nile Virus and HIV as well as  geospatial models to explain complex environmental phenomenon such as stream flow networks.
