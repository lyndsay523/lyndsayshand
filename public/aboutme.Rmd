I received my B.S. in Mathematics and Spanish at Bucknell University in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania after growing up skiing and swimming in Park City, Utah. Afterwards, I earned my Ph.D. in Statistics from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign where research focus was in spatial-temporal statistics. I built prediction models for the spatial spread of diseases such as West Nile Virus and HIV as well as built geospatial models to explain complex environmental phenomenon such as stream flow networks. 

At the University of Illinois,  I established and ran a pro-bono consulting organization for 3 years. I have worked as an internal statistical consultant for Dow Chemical and currently am a senior member of the technical staff at Sandia National Laboratories. I have experience providing my technical expertise to a wide variety of applications including evironmental, public health, national security, manufacturing, engineering, real estate, and more.
